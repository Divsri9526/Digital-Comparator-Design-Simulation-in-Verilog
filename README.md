# Digital-Comparator-Design-Simulation-in-Verilog

## üìå Overview

This project implements and simulates 1-bit and 4-bit digital comparators using Verilog HDL. The design determines equality, greater-than, and less-than relationships between binary inputs, with separate testbenches to validate functionality. These comparators are fundamental building blocks in processors, sorting units, and decision-making logic circuits. The repository includes clean, well-commented code, simulation results, and waveform outputs for academic and professional use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **1-Bit Comparator**: Compares single-bit inputs (A, B)
- **4-Bit Comparator**: Compares 4-bit binary inputs
- **Testbenches** for both designs
- Simulation-ready Verilog code
- Clean & well-commented source code
